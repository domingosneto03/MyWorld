For the first exercise we learned how to make transformations to CGFObjects, and how the stack of matrices and active matrix work in a way we can clear it before making the transformations for the next Object we want to display. Then we used this to display a group of CGFObjects with the necessary transformations to make the Tangram our group was assigned.

In exercise 2 we created the class MyUnitCube that defined 8 vertices of the cube. Then the cube's object was displayed in MyScene. Afterwards, we placed the cube behind the Tamgram and then, with the use of the transformations, the cube and the Tangram were parallel to xz plain.

In exercise 3 we observed that it is possible to make a complex Object just by invoking the same Object multiple times and making the necessary transformations to it.
