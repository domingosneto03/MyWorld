In the first exercise we mapped the texture from "tangram.png" on every vertex of each polygon. The necessary partitions were created with the help of the auxiliar texture "tangram-lines.png". 

In the second one, we applied the textures on the tangram and on the cube. On the cube, initially the texture image was unfocused. The solution was to alter the filtering type in order for the image to become more nitid.
